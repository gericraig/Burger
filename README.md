# Burger

This is suppose to be a burger selecting app using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. 

The app should work by letting the user choose a burger that they would like to eat by submitting a burger name. The burger should then be displayed with a devour button next to it. Once the user "devours" a burger it will be shown in a column with the other devoured burgers. The app should save all the burger information for the devoured and the not devoured.
